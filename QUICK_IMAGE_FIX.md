# Quick Image Performance Fix

## Problem

Images loading from Unsplash take 1-2 seconds, causing poor UX.

## Solution Summary

Replace external URLs with local static assets generated by AI.

## Quick Steps

### 1. Extract Current Images (DONE ✓)

```bash
node scripts/extract-image-urls.js
```

Result: 277 images identified (12 covers, 12 thumbnails, 253 nodes)

### 2. Generate AI Images

```bash
node scripts/generate-ai-prompts.js
```

This creates `AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.txt` with ready-to-use prompts.

**Recommended AI Tools:**

- **Midjourney** (best quality, $10/month)
- **Leonardo.ai** (free tier available)
- **DALL-E 3** (via ChatGPT Plus)
- **Stable Diffusion** (free, local)

**Batch Generation Tips:**

- Use `/imagine` in Midjourney with prompts from the file
- Request 800x600px landscape orientation
- Save as JPG for smaller file size
- Use exact filenames from prompts

### 3. Organize Images

Place generated images in:

```
src/assets/images/
├── covers/          # 12 cover images
├── thumbnails/      # 12 thumbnail images (can reuse covers)
└── nodes/           # 253 node images
```

### 4. Apply Migration

```bash
node scripts/apply-image-migration.js
```

This automatically updates all story files to use `require()` instead of URLs.

### 5. Test

```bash
npm start
```

Images should now load instantly!

## Alternative: Quick Start with Placeholders

If you want to test the system first, you can use placeholder images:

```bash
# Download a few placeholder images
curl -o src/assets/images/covers/placeholder.jpg https://via.placeholder.com/800x600
# Then manually update one story file to test
```

## Performance Improvement

- **Before**: 1-2 seconds per image (network request)
- **After**: <100ms per image (local asset)
- **Bundle size increase**: ~50-100MB (acceptable for mobile app)

## Notes

- Thumbnails can be the same as covers (React Native will resize)
- Consider using JPG instead of PNG to reduce bundle size
- Images are bundled with the app, so no internet required
