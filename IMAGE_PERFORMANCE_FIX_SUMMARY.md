## Solution Implemented

## What I've Set Up For You

### 1. Folder Structure âœ“

```
src/assets/images/
â”œâ”€â”€ covers/          # Story cover images (12 needed)
â”œâ”€â”€ thumbnails/      # Story thumbnails (12 needed)
â””â”€â”€ nodes/           # Individual story node images (253 needed)
```

### 2. Helper Scripts âœ“

#### `scripts/extract-image-urls.js`

- Scans all story files
- Extracts Unsplash URLs
- Creates IMAGE_MAPPING.json
- **Already run** - found 277 images total

#### `scripts/generate-ai-prompts.js`

- Reads story content and narration
- Generates AI-ready prompts
- Creates AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.txt
- **Already run** - 265 prompts ready

#### `scripts/apply-image-migration.js`

- Replaces all Unsplash URLs with require() statements
- Updates all story files automatically
- **Run this AFTER generating images**

#### `scripts/test-single-story.js`

- Test migration on one story first
- Preview changes before applying

### 3. Type Updates âœ“

Updated `src/types/index.ts` to support both:

- `string` (for URLs - current)
- `number` (for require() - after migration)

### 4. Documentation âœ“

- `IMAGE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed guide
- `QUICK_IMAGE_FIX.md` - Quick reference
- `EXAMPLE_MIGRATED_STORY.ts` - Shows final result
- `AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.txt` - Ready-to-use prompts

## Your Next Steps

### Option A: Full Migration (Recommended)

1. **Open AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.txt**

   - Contains 265 ready-to-use prompts
   - Each prompt includes filename and folder location

2. **Generate Images**

   - Use Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Leonardo.ai, or Stable Diffusion
   - Request 800x600px landscape images
   - Save as JPG with exact filenames from prompts

3. **Organize Images**

   - Place in correct folders (covers/, thumbnails/, nodes/)
   - Verify filenames match exactly

4. **Apply Migration**

   ```bash
   node scripts/apply-image-migration.js
   ```

5. **Test**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Option B: Test with One Story First

1. **Pick one story** (e.g., Deep Sea story has only 2 nodes)

   ```bash
   node scripts/test-single-story.js story4_deepsea.ts
   ```

2. **Generate just those images** (cover + thumbnail + 2 nodes = 4 images)

3. **Manually update that one file** to test

4. **If it works, proceed with full migration**

## AI Image Generation Tips

### Recommended Tools

1. **Midjourney** ($10/month)

   - Best quality
   - Fast generation
   - Use `/imagine` command

2. **Leonardo.ai** (Free tier)

   - Good quality
   - 150 images/day free
   - Easy batch generation

3. **DALL-E 3** (ChatGPT Plus)

   - Very good quality
   - Natural language prompts
   - $20/month

4. **Stable Diffusion** (Free)
   - Run locally
   - Unlimited generation
   - Requires setup

### Batch Generation Strategy

- Generate covers first (12 images)
- Test with one complete story
- Then batch-generate all node images
- Use consistent style across each story

### Prompt Tips

- Add "cinematic, high quality, detailed" to all prompts
- Specify "800x600px landscape orientation"
- Use story genre for style consistency
- Include lighting keywords (dramatic, soft, moody)

## Questions?

**Q: Can I use different image sizes?**
A: Yes, but 800x600 is optimal for mobile. React Native will resize as needed.

**Q: Can I mix URLs and local images?**
A: Yes! The types support both. Migrate gradually if you prefer.

**Q: What about image optimization?**
A: Use JPG instead of PNG. Consider tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG.

**Q: Can I change images later?**
A: Yes, just replace the file and rebuild the app.

**Q: Do I need all 277 images?**
A: Thumbnails can reuse cover images, so really ~265 unique images needed.
