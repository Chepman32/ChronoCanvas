# Image Loading Fix

## Issue

Some story nodes were showing black screens instead of images during playthrough.

## Root Cause

- Image URLs from Unsplash were failing to load in some cases
- No fallback mechanism when images failed
- No background color while images were loading
- Black screen appeared during load time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Fallback Image System

- Created `FALLBACK_IMAGE` constant with a reliable Unsplash URL
- Added `imageError` state to track failed image loads
- Automatically switches to fallback image on error

### 2. Error Handling

```typescript
<Image
  source={{ uri: imageError ? FALLBACK_IMAGE : currentNode.imageUrl }}
  onError={() => {
    console.log('Image failed to load:', currentNode.imageUrl);
    setImageError(true);
  }}
/>
```

### 3. Background Color

- Added dark background color (`#1a1a2e`) to image style
- Prevents black screen while image loads
- Provides better visual experience

### 4. Image Reset on Node Change

- Reset `imageError` state when navigating to new node
- Ensures each node tries to load its own image first
- Falls back only if that specific image fails

## Files Modified

- `src/screens/StoryPlayScreen.tsx` - Added fallback logic and error handling
- `src/utils/imageUrls.ts` - Created (for future use with curated image collections)

## Testing

1. Navigate through any story
2. Images should load smoothly
3. If an image fails, fallback image appears instead of black screen
4. Background color shows while images are loading

## Future Improvements

- Use the curated image collections from `imageUrls.ts`
- Add loading spinner while images load
- Implement progressive image loading
- Cache images locally for better performance
- Add retry mechanism for failed images

## Result

✅ No more black screens  
✅ Smooth image transitions  
✅ Better error handling  
✅ Improved user experience
