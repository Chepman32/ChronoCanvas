      "narration": "Time slows as you squeeze the trigger. The gunshot echoes through the cavernous warehouse. **Alan** staggers backward, the knife dropping from his hand. Your shot strikes true, incapacitating him before he could harm **Emily**. Officers swarm in and Emily runs toward you, but not before a stray piece of shrapnel from the concrete grazes her side. She winces in pain, bleeding lightly â€“ hurt but alive. Alan lies on the floor, wounded and moaning. As medics are called, you wrap Emily in a blanket. **The kidnapper is stopped permanently, and Emily is saved, but the violent end leaves you with a hollow feeling as dawn breaks.**",
