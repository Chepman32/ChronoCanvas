Across the room, a stranger named Alex laughs as they nearly spill their latte. Your eyes meet fleetingly and your heart skips. You feel an instant, warm curiosity. As Alex rises to leave, fiddling nervously with their jacket, you sense this could be a once-in-a-lifetime moment. Will you speak up or let them slip away?",

Before long, you are chatting easily about the book they are reading and the best coffee in town. The minutes fly by and Alex's eyes light up at each shared interest. Eventually, they glance at the time and mention an appointment. Standing together outside the cafe, you know you do not want this to be the last time you see them.",

When you part, it is with a gentle kiss under the streetlights and plans to see each other again. What started as a chance encounter at a cafe becomes the first chapter of a beautiful new romance.",

In the weeks that follow, you think of them often, hoping you will run into them again by chance. But life moves on, and although you shared a lovely chat, the spark never gets a chance to grow. Sometimes you catch yourself scanning crowds for that familiar face, wondering what if, before time and memory gently carry the moment away.",

You admit you did not want to miss the chance to get to know them. Alex blushes and confesses they were hoping you would say something. The two of you exchange numbers right there on the sidewalk, grinning ear to ear. As Alex walks away (for now), you already receive a text: \"Coffee again soon? :)\" It seems fate is giving you both a second chance after all.",

Days turn into weeks, and you never see them again. Sometimes, you replay that moment in your mind--the golden light, their warm smile--and imagine what you might have said. It becomes a bittersweet memory, a lesson about chances not taken. You promise yourself that next time, you will not let fear hold you back.",
