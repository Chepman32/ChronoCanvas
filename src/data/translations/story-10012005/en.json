You are Detective Inspector Grey, called to investigate. Lightning flashes, illuminating stern family portraits on the walls. You have two leads to begin with: examine the crime scene for physical clues, or gather the family and staff for initial questioning.",

Scanning the scene, you note a shattered glass and a faint scent of bitter almonds--cyanide, perhaps. On the floor by his hand, a monogrammed handkerchief with an ornate \"C\". Lady Blackwood's initial. The wall safe behind a painting is ajar, some contents missing. Each clue paints a suspect: Lady Catherine Blackwood or John the groundskeeper (who has access to gardening poisons). It is time to act on your deductions.",

Lady Blackwood claims she retired early and heard nothing, though her hands tremble. The butler interjects that he overheard Lord Blackwood quarreling with Groundskeeper John that afternoon about unpaid wages. John protests his innocence, saying he was tending the greenhouse all evening. Two narratives emerge: one implicating John's anger, another hinting at Lady Blackwood's nervous demeanor.",

She scoffs at first, but you methodically lay out the evidence--her handkerchief in the study, her access to cyanide (from treating Lord Blackwood's \"illness\"), the fact that only she could have opened the wall safe without signs of forced entry. Under the weight of proof, Lady Blackwood's composure cracks. She tearfully confesses: years of cruelty from her husband drove her to it. You escort her into custody. Justice is served, and as the storm passes, you depart the manor knowing you solved the case correctly.",

The case seems neatly closed. But weeks later, back in London, you receive a letter--the new detective assigned to Blackwood's estate found evidence of cyanide purchase traced to Lady Blackwood. By the time authorities went to question her, she had vanished overseas with her late husband's jewels. You realize with dread that you jailed an innocent man while the true murderer walked free. The mistake haunts your reputation and conscience.",

Lady Blackwood lets out a long sigh of relief. The case seems closed. However, in the following days, doubts niggle at you--there was scant hard evidence. Some time later, you hear Lady Blackwood sold the manor and left the country abruptly. It dawns on you that the real culprit may have escaped justice. You realize too late that the widow's act fooled everyone, and an innocent man paid the price. It is a failure that will haunt you for years.",
