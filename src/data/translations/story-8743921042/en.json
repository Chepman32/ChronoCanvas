    "description": "When the moon rises full over Blackbriar Forest, an old bargain wakes. You carry a shard of a broken sigil that hums near the trees, calling you toward a forgotten crown and a debt the grove intends to collect. Choose allies, honor, or power—but the grove always takes its due.",
