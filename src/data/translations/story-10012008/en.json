No one knows you are here. As nightfall looms, you face a critical choice: stay with the plane hoping for rescue, or venture down the treacherous slopes to find help yourself.",

As darkness falls, you gather whatever you can--seat cushions, bits of insulation--and huddle in a partially intact section of the fuselage. The wind howls outside. You have a few matches and the flare (but nothing to launch it). You consider how to signal your location and survive the freezing night ahead.",

A frozen waterfall creates a slick 30-foot cliff in your path. You could climb down here (risky), or detour through a dense pine forest on a gentler slope (safer but longer). Light is fading fast and the cold intensifies.",

Huddling near the flames, you fight off sleep despite the numbing cold. In the gray light of dawn, you hear the distant thump of helicopter blades. Climbing onto the plane's wing, you frantically wave the still-smoking blanket. A search-and-rescue chopper appears between the peaks! They spotted your fire's smoke. Relief floods you as help arrives--you've survived the frozen night and are safely lifted away from the icy wilderness.",

Curling up under pieces of fuselage and wrapping the blanket tight, you try to conserve heat. The night drags on in darkness and sub-zero cold. Without a fire or movement, your body temperature plummets. Sometime before dawn, shivering gives way to numb stillness. The next day, rescue helicopters spot the wreck--and find you inside, cold and peacefully still. You succumbed to the unforgiving cold mere hours before help arrived.",

You dangle for a heartbeat before your frozen grip fails--then you are tumbling. You crash through brittle ice into a ravine below. The world goes dark. Days later, a search party finds the ravine. Among the rocks and ice they discover your pack and realize tragically that your bid for survival ended in a fatal fall.",

It's slow going, and night forces you to shelter under pine boughs, but your steady progress continues at first light. By midday, you stumble onto a snow-covered road at the forest's edge. Not long after, a rumbling snowplow appears. The driver is astonished to find you. Wrapped in a warm blanket in the truck's cabin, you know you've made it out alive. It was not heroic or quick, but your careful choices have led you safely off the Frozen Pass and back to the world of the living.",
