# 🚀 Start Here - Fix Image Loading Performance

## The Problem

Your images are loading from Unsplash URLs, taking 1-2 seconds each. This creates a poor user experience.

## The Solution

Replace external URLs with local AI-generated images that load in <100ms.

## 🎯 What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Tool

Pick one:

- **Midjourney** - Best quality ($10/month) - Recommended
- **Leonardo.ai** - Good quality (150 free/day)
- **DALL-E 3** - Via ChatGPT Plus ($20/month)
- **Stable Diffusion** - Free but requires setup

### Step 2: Generate Images

1. Open `AI_IMAGE_PROMPTS.txt`
2. Copy prompts to your AI tool
3. Generate 800x600px landscape images
4. Save with exact filenames shown

**Pro tip**: Start with just one story (Deep Sea has only 4 images) to test the workflow.

### Step 3: Organize Files

Place generated images in:

```
src/assets/images/covers/     ← Cover images
src/assets/images/thumbnails/ ← Thumbnails (can reuse covers)
src/assets/images/nodes/      ← Story node images
```

### Step 4: Run Migration

```bash
node scripts/apply-image-migration.js
```

This automatically updates all story files.

### Step 5: Test

```bash
npm start
```

Images should now load instantly!

**Q: What if I don't like an image?**
A: Just regenerate it and replace the file.

**Q: Will this increase my app size?**
A: Yes, by ~50-100MB. But the performance gain is worth it.
