## üìù Prompt Template

````
I need you to create an interactive story for a React Native mobile app called ChronoCanvas.
The story should follow this exact TypeScript structure:

STORY REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: [Your Story Title]
- Genre: [Choose 1-2: fantasy, scifi, mystery, romance, horror, adventure]
- Difficulty: [easy, medium, or hard]
- Duration: [20-45 minutes]
- Premium: [true or false]
- Number of nodes: [20-26 nodes]
- Number of endings: [2-5 unique endings]

STORY STRUCTURE:
Generate a complete Story object with this TypeScript interface:

```typescript
{
  id: 'story-[number]',
  title: '[Story Title]',
  description: '[2-3 sentence hook that makes readers want to play]',
  coverImageUrl: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]?w=800',
  thumbnailUrl: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[id]?w=400',
  author: '[Author Name]',
  genre: ['[genre1]', '[genre2]'],
  difficulty: '[easy/medium/hard]',
  estimatedDuration: [number in minutes],
  isPremium: [true/false],
  productId: '[if premium: com.app.story.story-name]',
  version: '1.0',
  createdAt: '2025-01-[date]',
  updatedAt: '2025-01-[date]',
  totalNodes: [20-26],
  totalEndings: [2-5],
  startNodeId: '[story-id]-1',
  nodes: [
    // Generate 20-26 nodes following this pattern
  ]
}
````

NODE STRUCTURE:
Each node must follow this format:

```typescript
{
  id: '[story-id]-[number]',
  storyId: '[story-id]',
  type: 'start' | 'decision' | 'ending',
  title: '[Scene Title - 2-4 words]',
  imageUrl: 'https://images.unsplash.com/photo-[relevant-id]?w=800',
  narration: '[3-5 sentences describing the scene, what's happening, and the tension/stakes]',
  choices: [
    {
      id: '[story-id]-c[number]',
      text: '[Choice text - action the player takes]',
      description: '[Optional: consequence hint]',
      targetNodeId: '[story-id]-[target-node-number]',
      order: 1
    },
    // 2-3 choices per decision node
  ]
}
```

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. First node (id: [story-id]-1) must have type: 'start'
2. Last 2-5 nodes must have type: 'ending' with empty choices array
3. All middle nodes have type: 'decision' with 2-3 choices each
4. Each choice must point to a valid targetNodeId
5. Create branching paths - not all nodes need to be sequential
6. Narration should be immersive, descriptive, and engaging
7. Choices should be meaningful and affect the story outcome
8. Each ending should be distinctly different
9. Use real Unsplash photo IDs that match the scene theme
10. Node titles should be evocative and intriguing

STORY THEME: [Describe your story theme here]
SETTING: [Describe the setting]
PROTAGONIST: [Describe the main character]
CONFLICT: [Describe the main conflict/challenge]
TONE: [Describe the tone: dark, lighthearted, suspenseful, etc.]

EXAMPLE BRANCHING STRUCTURE:
Node 1 (start) ‚Üí Node 2 or Node 3
Node 2 ‚Üí Node 4 or Node 5
Node 3 ‚Üí Node 5 or Node 6
Node 4 ‚Üí Node 7 or Node 8
... continue branching ...
Final nodes (20-26) ‚Üí Endings with no choices

Please generate the complete story with all nodes, ensuring:

- Rich, descriptive narration for each scene
- Meaningful choices that impact the story
- Multiple paths leading to different endings
- Consistent story logic and continuity
- Proper TypeScript syntax
- Valid Unsplash image URLs

Output the complete TypeScript code ready to paste into the app.

## üí° Tips for Better Stories

### Narration Tips

- Use sensory details (sight, sound, smell, touch)
- Create tension and stakes in every scene
- Show, don't tell
- End scenes with hooks that make players want to continue
- Vary sentence length for rhythm

### Choice Design Tips

- Make choices meaningful, not arbitrary
- Include moral dilemmas
- Show consequences of previous choices
- Avoid "correct" vs "wrong" choices - make them interesting vs interesting
- Use choice descriptions to hint at outcomes

### Branching Tips

- Create at least 3 distinct paths through the story
- Allow paths to converge and diverge
- Make sure all paths lead to an ending
- Different paths should reveal different aspects of the story
- Consider having a "golden path" with the most content

### Image Selection Tips

- Search Unsplash for: [your theme] + [mood]
- Use consistent visual style throughout
- Match image tone to scene tone
- Avoid images with text or faces (unless character-focused)
- Test image URLs before finalizing
